    <p>Although these ladybeetles may bite, this bite does not seriously injure humans or spread diseases. If crushed, the beetles will emit a foul odor and leave a stain. The dust produced from an accumulation of dead Multicolored Asian Lady Beetles behind wall voids may trigger allergies or asthma in people.</p>
